# -Impact-of-Agricultural-Shocks-on-Business-Cycles-in-India-A-Real-Business-Cycle-Approach
This project analyzes agricultural shocks' impact on India's business cycle using a two-sector RBC model, incorporating land and rainfall variability. Calibrated with 1995–2024 data, it shows irrigation mitigates weak rainfall effects. Includes slides, equations, and scripts for macroeconomic policy insights.
Effect of Agricultural Shocks on India's Business Cycle

Overview:
This project analyzes the impact of agricultural shocks, particularly rainfall variability, on India's business cycle using a Real Business Cycle (RBC) framework. Extending Da-Rocha and Restuccia (2002), we develop a two-sector model (agriculture and non-agriculture) incorporating land and rainfall shocks. It uses 1995–2024 data from five Indian states to study labor reallocation, output volatility, and correlations with rainfall, irrigation, and agricultural GVA.

Key Features:
Model: Two-sector RBC model with land in the agricultural production function and rainfall as a stochastic shock.
Data: 150 observations from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh (1995–2024).
Analysis: Examines correlations between rainfall, food grain production, irrigation, temperature, and GVA.


Findings: 
Irrigation (r=0.862 with output) mitigates weak rainfall effects (r=0.126); agriculture drives output volatility.

Methodology:
Model Extension: Added land and rainfall shocks to Da-Rocha & Restuccia’s framework.

Calibration: 
Used empirical rainfall data for an agrarian economy.

Simulation:
Analyzed labor reallocation and output volatility.

Data Analysis:
Pearson correlations for key variables.

Results:
Benchmark (U.S.-like): Output volatility ((\sigma_Y=2.00)), employment volatility ((\sigma_L/\sigma_Y=0.65)).
High Agri Share (Turkey-like): (\sigma_Y=2.74), (\sigma_L/\sigma_Y=0.49).

Correlations: 
Irrigation vs. Food Grain (r=0.862), Rainfall vs. Food Grain (r=0.126), Agri. GVA vs. Food Grain (r=-0.784).

Conclusions:
Agriculture’s counter-cyclical employment and high volatility shape India’s business cycles. Irrigation enhances resilience against rainfall shocks. Policymakers should invest in agricultural infrastructure.
